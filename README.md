# GetPyPi_v2
Crawls Pipi And stores both module and module description.

Webcrawlers designed for harvesting pypi packages.

1. Make sure you have enough space on whatever you configure to be the destination directory
2. Configure a destination directory path in config.txt 
3. Run a program individually or run GetPypiv2 (included) and select an option to download pretty much everything,
either by 'os' or by 'programming language'.
4. (I advise downloading all os and all programming language if you want to be thorough, expect around 160GB of space needed).

Fun Fact: This will take a while and also each module will be stored with its own description file in its own directory which could be used for parsing if one had to blindly dig for something useful pertaining to any given thing in particular.
