# GetPyPi_v2
Crawls Pipi And stores both module and module description.

Webcrawlers designed for harvesting pypi packages.

1. Make sure you have enough space on whatever you configure to be the destination directory
2. Configure a destination directory path in config.txt 
3. Run each program individually or run GetPypiv2 (included) and select an option to download pretty much everything,
either by 'os' or by 'programming language'.

Fun Fact: This will yake a while and also each module will be stored with its own description file in its own directory which could be used for parsing if one had to dig.
